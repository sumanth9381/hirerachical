## project title
Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers.csv" of American mall market called as Phonix Mall,to findout requirements of dendrogram using seipy library with the help of "seipy.cluster.hirearchy ,to ace the no of linkage of the clustering to predict

## PROJECT TITLE :The american finance market client as per the rate of gdp of 2011 found as highest number of growth in there business market.
As a data science engineer findout which hirerachy gives upcoming feature

## TASk
1. with the help of seipy import the libraries and datasets
2. using the dendogram to find the optimal number of the clusters
3. create the hirearchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplot librarie

## CONCLUSION
According to the model building as a enginner my prediction is cluster number 3 heighest number linkage.
## INSIGHTS
1: Cluster 1 contains(red) colour which shows that unsupervize learning cluster as maximum eucluid from the centriod upto annual income approximate 139ks.


2: Cluster 2 contains(blue) which showa that unseprvize learning cluster as maximum eucluid from centriod upto annual income approximatly 80ks.

3: Cluster 3 contains(green) colour which shows that unsupervize learning cluster as maximum eucluid from the centriod upto annual income approximate 135ks.


4: Cluster 4 contains(sky blue) which showa that unseprvize learning cluster as maximum eucluid from centriod upto annual income approximatly .
 
5: Cluster 5 contains(pink) colour which shows that unsupervize learning cluster as maximum eucluid from the centriod upto annual income approximate 41ks.
